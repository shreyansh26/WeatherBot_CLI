Weather Bot
===========

This is a rule base Command line Interface (CLI) bot which can converse with the user and tell the current weather for any location. It can also help to forecast weather for next two days.

The bot is rule based i.e it uses Regular Expressions (RegEx) to interpret the user's inputs.

For getting the weather the bot uses the Yahoo! Weather API.
